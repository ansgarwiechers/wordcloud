=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: keywords

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Extracts marked keywords form the individual stories places them
to marked spot in the generated text. Can be used to generate
the <meta name="keywords" value="..."> in HTML header files

The keywords in the individual stories have to be enclosed
either with the <kw></kw> tag or with the <kwx></kwx> tag.
The <kw>keywords</kw> we be left in the individual stories, 
the <kwx>keywords</kwx> will be removed.

The keywords will be sorted by their weighted frequencies. 
The weight is determined by the variable $story_weight, which will 
be decremented after each displayed story until it reaches the
value 1.

Keywords in story's title get the doble weight

The place in the resulting text, where the keywords have to be placed
must be marked with the placeholder {keywords}.

Example: <meta name="keywords" content="{keywords}">
